# Claude Interactive PoC

Proof of concept: running Claude Code as an **interactive session** inside GitHub Actions via `tmux`, bypassing the programmatic usage credit pool introduced on June 15, 2026.

## What this does

Every 6 hours, a GitHub Action:

1. Starts a `tmux` session (real PTY)
2. Launches `claude` **without the `-p` flag** (interactive mode)
3. Sends a prompt via `tmux send-keys` (simulating keyboard input)
4. Waits for Claude Code to finish (output stabilization detection)
5. Commits the result to `log.txt`

From Claude Code's perspective, this is indistinguishable from a human opening a terminal and typing. Because it *is* a terminal. `isatty()` returns `true`. The PTY is real. The input arrives as keystrokes.

## Why this exists

On May 13, 2026, Anthropic announced that starting June 15, `claude -p` and Agent SDK usage would be separated into a dedicated credit pool billed at full API rates ($20-$200/month depending on plan), while interactive usage remains on the subsidized subscription pool.

This PoC demonstrates that the distinction between "interactive" and "programmatic" is a policy fiction, not a technical boundary.

## Setup

### 1. Generate a Long-Lived Token

On a machine where you're logged into Claude Code with your Max/Pro subscription:

```bash
claude auth long-lived-token
```

You'll get output like this:

```
Generated long-lived token:
sk-ant-lltt-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

This token:
  - Is tied to your current Claude subscription
  - Expires in 1 year
  - Can be revoked at any time via `claude auth revoke`
  - Does NOT refresh automatically like OAuth tokens

Store it somewhere safe. It will not be shown again.
```

Copy the `sk-ant-lltt-...` token. Unlike the standard OAuth flow that refreshes every 12 hours and would die on you mid-cron, this one lives for a year.

### 2. Add GitHub Secret

Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret:

- **Name:** `CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN`  
- **Value:** The `sk-ant-lltt-...` token from step 1

The secret is necessary because the GitHub Actions runner is an ephemeral container with no persistent storage. It doesn't have your `~/.claude/` directory, your login session, or any idea who you are. The secret is the only way to pass auth without hardcoding it in the repo (which would be publishing your subscription token to the world on a public repo).

### 3. Enable the workflow

The workflow runs on:
- **Schedule:** Every 6 hours (`0 */6 * * *`)
- **Manual dispatch:** Click "Run workflow" in the Actions tab

### 4. Permissions

The workflow needs `contents: write` permission to commit changes. This is configured in the workflow file.

```

The process tree: `bash → tmux → bash → claude`

This is the same process tree you'd see from any terminal emulator (GNOME Terminal, iTerm2, Alacritty). There is no technical mechanism to differentiate the two.

```

## Limitations

- **Auth token management:** OAuth tokens expire. You may need to refresh `CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN` periodically.
- **Completion detection:** Uses output stabilization (buffer unchanged for 9s) which is heuristic. Complex tasks may need longer timeouts.
- **No streaming output:** You see the result after completion, not in real-time.
- **Runner IP ranges:** Anthropic *could* theoretically block GitHub Actions IP ranges, but this would also break legitimate interactive usage from cloud VMs, Codespaces, and remote development environments.

## Standalone usage

The orchestration script also works standalone on any Linux/macOS machine:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/interactive-claude.sh
./scripts/interactive-claude.sh "Add today's date to log.txt"
```

## Disclaimer

This is a technical proof of concept demonstrating that the interactive/programmatic distinction is unenforceable at the protocol level. Use responsibly and in compliance with Anthropic's Terms of Service as you understand them.
